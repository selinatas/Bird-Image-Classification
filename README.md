# Bird-Image-Classification
This group project focuses on image classification of bird species using the images of 525 bird species,
including a large collection of high-quality images. The primary objective was to develop models capable of
identifying different bird species, which could aid in protecting areas with endangered and endemic species.
We used machine learning techniques like random forest, support vector machine, PCA, and deep learning
algorithms, including convolutional neural networks and artificial neural networks, addressing dataset
imbalances through preprocessing methods like random selection and oversampling.
